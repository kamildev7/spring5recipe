# Spring Boot Recipe Application [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/kamildev7/spring5recipe.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/kamildev7/spring5recipe)

A simple crud app in spring 5 with Docker.
Check out other branchers:
- mongodbProject - I switched from to MongoDB database (I hadn't used this db before). 
- reactive-programming - I started to learn basics of Reactive Programming, Spring WebFlux etc.
I changed code to be more reactive.
